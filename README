** To produce the mass scan cards (October 2015):

> python nameCards.py

Requires inputs (in inputCards folder) and gamma_sm.py (Higgs width). It is a direct copy of HZZ



** To submit a gridpack in powheg:

> python sendGridpack.csh

Requires templateSend.csh 
For JHU Generator v6.2.8., use modified create_powheg_tarball.sh in this folder.
It can be adapated for any datacard, if no JHU used just select none.



** To check powheg grids:

inside the tarball there should be a file called: pwg-btlgrid.top 

>  ./td pwg-btlgrid.top 

Plots should be smooth and sinusoidal.



** To run the grids and get a LHE file:

untar the gridpack in a folder, modify templateGrid.csh and run:

> bsub -R "pool>30000" -q 2nw -J job1 < templateGrid.csh



** To test a LHE:

Use out of the box the Latinos package:

https://github.com/latinos/LatinoTreesLHE



** To create MCFM lhe files:

Modify input card in MCFM folder and run:

> templateMCFM_RGS.csh



** To upload LHE files to EOS:

> cmsLHEtoEOSManager.py -n  -f  card.lhe > nameoflog.log&


if you have .dat LHE files, they have to be renamed to .lhe before upload:

> rename .dat .lhe *

For several lhe files to be copied into one folder:

> echo `ls -1 | grep lhe | tr "\n" "@" | sed -e s%lhe@%lhe,%g` | tr "\n" "@" | sed -e s%,@%@%g | tr "@" "\n" > files.txt

and then:

> cmsLHEtoEOSManager.py -n  -f `cat files.txt` > nameoflog.log&
