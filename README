Several things, based in HZZ:


** To produce the mass scan cards (October 2015):

> python nameCards.py

Requires inputs (in inputCards folder) and gamma_sm.py (Higgs width). It is a direct copy of HZZ


** To submit a gridpack in powheg:

> python sendGridpack.csh

Requires templateSend.csh 
For JHU Generator v6.2.8., use modified create_powheg_tarball.sh in this folder.
It can be adapated for any datacard, if no JHU used just select none.


** To run the grids and get a LHE file:

untar the gridpack in a folder, modify templateGrid.csh and run:

> bsub -R "pool>30000" -q 2nw -J job1 < templateGrid.csh


** To test a LHE

Use out of the box the Latinos package:

https://github.com/latinos/LatinoTreesLHE


** To create MCFM lhe files:

Modify input card in MCFM folder and run:

> templateMCFM_RGS.csh
